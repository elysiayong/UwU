# UwU
"UwU" is a small bullet-hell game, made for code practicing purposes. However, the game can be played without an IDE if you just want to try it out. 

# How to run the game
A. Download the executable and launch the game; ensure that 'UwU.exe' and 'gamething' are in the same folder or else the game will not launch. 

OR

B. Clone the git repository and ensure the following: 
  1) Ensure the Java Build Path libraries contains all associated .jar files in /UwU/gamething/res/jars
  2) Ensure that lwjgl.jar is able to locate the Native Library files in /UwU/gamething/res/native/* (please select the folder associated with your operating system). 

// Instructions to launch the game via the Eclipse IDE will come soon.
